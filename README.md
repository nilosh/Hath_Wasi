Android Application: Hath Wasi - Sri Lankan Traditional Card Game

### Project Team
Aces

## Background

Apart from portability and communication, mobile devices today, provide many other functionalities such as entertainment, record-keeping etc. In the context of entertainment through mobile devices, gaming takes a prominent place, especially between the youth. However, while these advancements take place, people tend to move away from socializing with friends and family due to their busy schedules. This has resulted in the decline of people playing real games together.
In particular, for instance, people have moved away from playing card games together due to their busy schedules. Also, we have identified that traditional card games are very popular among the older generation whereas not amongst the younger generation. In order to address this problem, we intend to implement an android mobile application, which is a Sri Lankan traditional card game named ‘Hath Wāsi’. This application will allow the users to play the game, while educating the younger generation on this game. We believe that this application will bring back the exposure to this game without letting it decline.

## Scope Statement

This project is carried out for the development of a mobile application on a Sri Lankan traditional card game named ‘Hath Wāsi’. This is a game played among three players and via the application to be built, two players will be replaced by automated players. Therefore, the card game enthusiasts are given the privilege of playing the game at any given time amidst their busy schedules. The users of this application are eligible to play the traditional card game and check their performance on previous game rounds as well, while for users who are new to the game are encouraged to make use of the instructions page available in the home page of the application which explains how the game will be played and its rules. The user interface of the game is highly interactive and attractive and is a key feature to attract users towards the game.
